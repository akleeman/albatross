General Cleanup
===============
- simpler syntax in readme (no need to namespace everything)
- remove clang tooling dependency and options
- DCSV_IO_NO_THREAD should go in the tests CMakeLists.txt (I think)
- remove rapidcheck submodule
- possible to typeset in LaTeX the function in the readme?
- change filename parameter_handler.h to parameter_handling_mixin.h?

Code
====
- IMO ParameterHandlingMixin should be concerned only with the bookkeeping necessary to
  handle parameters internally. I think creating a ParameterHandlingMixin instance from
  YAML is a separate concern and that logic should live elsewhere. Unless the YAML structure
  is integral to the behavior and implementation of the ParameterHandlingMixin, I would
  definitely advocate for separating the internal programmer's use of the class from the
  external "populate from file" use of the class. This will let you focus on the internal
  representation corner cases we discussed without bloating the class with parsing methods.

- In model.h: typically the include guards should go at the very top of the file. 
  Putting them after   the license is also acceptable, but definitely before any 
  other #include statements.

- You can use the 'inline' keyword when defining functions or methods in headers.

- covariance_base.h probably will benefit from further iteration/refinement.

- lets see what issues arise and try and refine the parameter handling and model
  composition mechanisms as we learn more about it.
