Introduction
--------------

Gaussian processes are quite popular in geostatistics, though they are perhaps more commonly used in `Kriging`_.  The idea is very similar to the :ref:`1D Example <1d-example>`, there is some unknown function (in our example it will be temperature as a function of location) and you have noisy observations of the function (from weather stations) which you would like to use to make estimates at new locations.

Temperature Data
------------------

For this example we'll use the `Global Summary of the Day`_ (GSOD) data to produce an estimate of the average temperature for a given day over the continental United States (CONUS).

Here are the GSOD observation of average temperature for May 1st, 2018,

Temperature Model
------------------

We're going to build our temperature model to incorporate the following priors about how temperature should be have.

- Temperature at neighboring locations should be similar.
- There is some non-zero average temperature.
- Temperature decreases with elevation

To accomplish this we can build a covariance function that is not dissimilar from the one used in the :ref:`1D Example <1d-example>`.
We can start with measurement noise,

.. code-block:: c

  using Noise = IndependentNoise<Station>;
  CovarianceFunction<Noise> noise = {Noise(2.0)};

Which will include a term in our model which states that each weather station makes observations of the average temperature which are centered around the true average temperature but with a noise having standard deviation of :math:`2` degrees.

We can then define a mean value for our field.  In reality we might expect that the mean average temperature for a day would vary geographically, for this model we'll simply claim that there is some mean average temperature for all of CONUS,

.. code-block:: c

  CovarianceFunction<Constant> mean = {Constant(1.5)};

Then as we'd mentioned we'd like to include the concept of temperature decreasing with elevation.  To do this we can
create a scaling term which scales the mean value based on the elevation.  The


.. math::

  \mbox{elevation_scaling}(h) = 1. + \alpha \left(H - h\right)_{+}.

Where :math:`\left(\cdot\right)_{+}` could also be written :math:`\mbox{max}(0, \cdot)` and means it returns the
argument if positive and is otherwise :math:`0`.  The resulting function will decrease at a rate of :math:`\alpha`
until :math:`h >= H` afterwhich the scaling term will flatten out to a constant value of :math:`1`.  By multiplying
this term through with the mean we get a prior which will allow for higher temperatures at low elevations.

.. code-block:: c

  // Scale the constant temperature value in a way that defaults
  // to colder values for higher elevations.
  using ElevationScalar = ScalingTerm<ElevationScalingFunction>;
  CovarianceFunction<ElevationScalar> elevation_scalar = {ElevationScalar()};
  auto elevation_scaled_mean = elevation_scalar * mean;

Now we capture the spatial variation by saying that location near
each other in terms of great circle distance will be similar,

.. code-block:: c

  // The angular distance is equivalent to the great circle distance
  using AngularSqrExp = SquaredExponential<StationDistance<AngularDistance>>;
  CovarianceFunction<AngularSqrExp> angular_sqrexp = {AngularSqrExp(9e-2, 3.5)};

Then add that stations at different elevations will be dissimilar,

.. code-block:: c

  // Radial distance is the difference in lengths of the X, Y, Z
  // vectors, which translates into a difference in height so
  // this term means "station at different elevations will be less correlated"
  using RadialExp = Exponential<StationDistance<RadialDistance>>;
  CovarianceFunction<RadialExp> radial_exp = {RadialExp(15000., 2.5)};

These can be combined to get our final covariance function,

.. code-block:: c

  auto spatial_cov = angular_sqrexp * radial_exp;
  auto covariance = elevation_scaled_mean + noise + spatial_cov;

For the full implementation details see the `example code`_.

-------------------
Gridded Predictions
-------------------

Now that we've defined the covariance function we can let ``albatross`` do the rest!

.. code-block:: c

  auto model = gp_from_covariance<Station>(covariance);
  model.fit(data);
  const auto predictions = model.predict(grid_locations);

The ``predictions`` hold information about the mean and variance of the resulting estimates.  We can look at the mean of the estimates,

   :align: center

and perhaps more interestingly we can also get out the variance, or how confident the model is about its predictions,

   :align: center

Notice that the model is capable of realizing that it's estimates should be trusted less in mountainous regions!
